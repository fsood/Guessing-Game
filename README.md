The RGB Guessing Game is an interactive web-based challenge that tests your ability to identify colors based on their RGB values. Players are presented with a set of colored squares, each representing a unique RGB color. One of the squares is randomly selected to set the color of the game's title header. Players must then deduce which square corresponds to the header color by matching the RGB components. The game offers two difficulty levels, "Easy" and "Hard," each involving different numbers of squares to choose from. This engaging game encourages color perception and enhances familiarity with RGB color representation while providing an enjoyable and educational experience.



The RGB Guessing Game is developed using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used to structure the content and elements of the web page, CSS is employed for styling and layout design, and JavaScript adds interactivity and logic to create the dynamic gameplay experience. This amalgamation of technologies results in an engaging and user-friendly game where players can test their color recognition skills.
